+1. Introduction
+----------------
+ Auditorium Booking System allows theatre staff to book seats for customers and track their management information
+ using built-in figures that display all relevant information that the company may require.
+
+2. Requirements
+----------------
+ Must be ran on python 3.x
+ The program requires no external modules to work on python 3.x
+ All that is externally required from the main.py that is ran is Booking.db and customer_infobox_gen_EXAMPLE.py
+
+3. Configuration/Testing
+-------------------------
+ Alternatively, those who might want to test the database, or look to see how it was made can open the Booking.py
+ file in IDLE mode to show the database creation code.
+
+ To create a new fresh database, the standard Booking.db that comes with the system can be deleted, and the Booking.py
+ file must be ran.
